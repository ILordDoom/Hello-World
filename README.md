# Hello-World
The projects in this repository helps to understand the workings of github

HI world.

This is me getting started and understanding how github works. With big plans on creating many projects with the help of github. I am an IT student who has very little confidence in his skills and abilities. Hoping by June/2022 I am a much more confident person in my skills as well as myself. To a great year ahead!!
